### Passive Buff Collection Items

- **Stackable, Limited Slots:**  
  - Passive Buff items cannot be materialized or equipped, but can be “activated” for their bonus.
  - Each item provides a unique, ongoing passive effect (e.g., +3% gold gain per Ancient Coin).
  - Players may have up to **5 passive buffs active at once**—any combination or duplicates.
  - **Stacking:** Using the same buff item multiple times stacks its effect (e.g., 5 Ancient Coins = +15% gold gain).
  - If a 6th is activated, the player must choose and replace one of the currently active buffs.
  - Each copy is consumed or “locked” in the collection while active.

#### Example Passive Buff Items

| Item Name            | Effect                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ancient Coin         | +3% coins earned from all sources (stacks)   |
| Lucky Rabbit’s Foot  | +2% item drop rate (stacks)                  |
| Collector’s Badge    | +5% rare card chance (stacks)                |
| Book of Endurance    | +10 max stamina (stacks)                     |
| Spirit Lantern       | -5% ghost damage (stacks)                    |
| Potion of the Scholar| +5% experience gain (stacks)                 |

#### Buff Management Example

- **Activating Buffs:** Players may activate up to 5 passive buff items, choosing any combination and stacking multiples of the same type.
- **Switching Buffs:** Activating a 6th requires the player to remove one currently active buff (returning that item to the collection if not consumed).
- **Stacking Example:**  
  - 3 Ancient Coins + 2 Lucky Rabbit’s Foot = +9% coin gain, +4% item drop rate.
  - 5 Ancient Coins = +15% coin gain.
- **Inventory Handling:** Each active buff consumes a separate item; you need 5 Ancient Coins to activate the effect 5 times.
- **(Optional) Consumption:** Decide if active buffs consume the item permanently or just “lock” it while the buff is active.
