**Design Notes:**  
- All rewards follow your system: two actives, one passive, and match your rarity curve.
- Blue Wolf path focuses on evasion, regen, defense, and night synergy.
- Black Wolf path is aggressive: bleed, crit, attack boosts, and darkness/night synergy.
- Universal rewards are useful for all and themed to the mountain.
