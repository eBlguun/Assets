## 📖 Core Lore

- **Lucian** was once a hero who united the **Magical Cards** to defeat the **Demon Lord**.  
- In the final strike, the Demon Lord's essence **possessed Lucian’s body**, sealing his **soul** away.  
- Lucian’s corrupted body became the **Lost Demon King**, and his inner soul was locked inside the chamber (Season 1’s Forgotten Hero Trial).  
- His possession sparked the **Holy War**, where both **Relic Guardians** and the **Demon Army** perished.  
- The **Magical Cards shattered and scattered** across the world.  
- From the battlefield rose the **Lost Souls**, echoes of the fallen warriors.
