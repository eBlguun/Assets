# Forgotten Hero: Lore & Collection Theme

Long ago, before the world divided into courts, carnivals, forges, and legacies, there was one who wandered every path, fought every battle, and bore every burden: the Forgotten Hero.

It is said that all the greatest weapons, relics, and treasures now scattered among the five collections were once wielded by this singular figure—a champion whose deeds shaped the fate of empires, but whose name was erased by time, jealousy, and the shifting winds of history. Each collection still carries echoes of the Hero’s journey, and every boss guards a fragment of their legacy.

Yet, as generations passed, the Hero’s honor was forgotten. Their victories became mere myth, their memory lost beneath layers of pride and ambition. Only those who conquer every collection, who gather the cross-collection items that once formed the Hero’s regalia, can begin to piece together the true story—and perhaps restore their honor.

> **Game Mechanic Suggestion:**  
> If a player collects all cross-collection items and defeats every boss, they unlock the "Forgotten Hero’s Legacy" set—granting unique powers and revealing the Hero’s hidden history.
