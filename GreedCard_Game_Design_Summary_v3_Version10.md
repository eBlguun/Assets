### Passive Buff Collection Items — Stack Limits by Rarity

- **Stack Limits by Rarity:**  
  Players can activate multiple copies of passive buff items, but the maximum number of stacks depends on the item’s rarity:

  | Rarity    | Max Stacks per Buff |
  |-----------|:------------------:|
  | Common    |         5          |
  | Uncommon  |         4          |
  | Rare      |         3          |
  | Epic      |         3          |
  | Mythic    |         2          |
  | Legendary |         2          |
  | Godly     |         1          |

- **Total Passive Buff Slots:**  
  Players can have a maximum of 5 buff slots active at once (any combination, within rarity stack limits).

- **Buff Activation:**
  - Activating more than the allowed stacks for a given rarity is not permitted.
  - If trying to exceed the overall buff slot limit (5), the player must choose a buff to replace.
  - Godly buffs cannot be stacked; only one instance may be active at a time.

#### Example Usage

- 5x Common Ancient Coin (+15% gold gain)
- 2x Mythic General’s Charm (+4% mythic chance from packs)
- 1x Godly Phoenix Feather (+10% revive chance, cannot be stacked)

> *This stacking system balances the power of rare buffs and encourages strategic buff combinations while preventing game-breaking stacking of high-rarity effects.*
