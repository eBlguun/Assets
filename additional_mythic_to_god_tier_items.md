## Balancing Notes for High-Tier Items

1. **Acquisition Difficulty:**
   - Mythic: Extremely rare drops from world bosses (0.5% chance)
   - Legend: Requires materials from multiple raid bosses plus rare crafting components
   - God: Only obtainable through special events or complete collection achievements

2. **PvP Considerations:**
   - Long cooldown "instant defeat" skills should not work against players above 25% HP
   - Effects like "cannot be resurrected" should have counterplay items
   - Time-altering skills affect duration based on target's power level

3. **Collection Loss Risk:**
   - Higher tier items should have some protection against being stolen
   - Suggest: God tier items can only be lost if defeated by another player with at least 2 God tier items
   - Legend tier requires defeating player to have at least 1 Legend tier item to steal

4. **Progression Path:**
   - Create upgrade paths allowing Mythic items to evolve to Legend with special materials
   - God tier should remain extremely exclusive, requiring unique achievements

5. **Cosmetic Effects:**
   - Each tier should have increasingly impressive visual effects
   - God tier items should transform the player's appearance while equipped
