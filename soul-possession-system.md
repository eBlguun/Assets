# Soul Possession System – Special Skills & Passives

## Overview

In the world shaped by the aftermath of the Holy War and the scattering of the Magical Cards, the "souls of the fallen" (those who perished in the war, both heroes and villains) linger as powerful, restless spirits. Occasionally, these souls find resonance with living **Relic Hunters**—individuals seeking the cards' power—offering them unique abilities and traits.

When a player is "possessed" by a soul, they gain special **active skills** and **passive effects** based on that soul’s former life and legend. These souls are collectible, with their own rarity tiers and lore, and can dramatically change playstyle and power.

## Soul Rarity Tiers

- **Rare:** The most common soul tier. Grants one unique active skill and one passive effect, inspired by minor heroes, soldiers, or villains of the Holy War.
- **Epic:** More powerful souls, often belonging to notable champions or infamous adversaries. Grants stronger skills and passives.
- **Mythic:** Extremely rare; souls of legendary warriors, mages, or generals. Skills are highly impactful and may have special effects or triggers.
- **Legendary:** Souls of historic figures who shaped the world, offering game-changing skills and passives. Highly sought after and very limited.
- **Godly (Robux Exclusive):** The pinnacle of soul possession, representing the souls of the most powerful beings in history. Only obtainable via Robux purchases. Examples include:
  - **The Demon Lord** (the ultimate evil)
  - **The Forgotten Hero (Lucian_Q3)** (the hero who both saved and doomed the world)
  - **The Leader of the Relic Guardians** (the immortal protector of balance)
