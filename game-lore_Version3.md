Long, long ago, in the primordial age of creation, there existed a set of mystical artifacts known as the **Magical Cards**. Each card held within it a fragment of immense, ancient power—elements that could bend reality, command the forces of nature, and even reshape the fate of worlds. Legends whispered that whoever possessed these cards would wield unimaginable strength, but such power came at a terrible price: the hearts of those who held the cards grew insatiably greedy, consumed by a desire to accumulate all the cards and rule the cosmos.

Among all, there arose a chosen champion—a hero named **Lucian_Q3**. Unlike any before him, Lucian_Q3 managed to unite all the Magical Cards, wielding their combined might. With this unmatched power, he stood against the greatest evil of his time: the Demon Lord, a being who sought to drown the world in darkness. In a legendary battle that scarred the very heavens and earth, Lucian_Q3 defeated the Demon Lord, saving the world from annihilation.

Yet, victory came with an unseen price. The overwhelming power of the cards began to corrupt Lucian_Q3, twisting the hero’s noble heart with insidious greed and ambition. Fearing the devastation their champion might unleash, the **Relic Guardians**—immortal beings appointed by the God of Balance—made a tragic decision. They confronted Lucian_Q3 in a battle of sorrow and necessity, ultimately slaying their once-greatest ally to prevent the cards’ corruption from consuming the world.

With Lucian_Q3 defeated, the Relic Guardians gathered the Magical Cards and sealed them away, scattering them to hidden sanctuaries across the realms. But the echo of betrayal and regret lingered. Those who had followed Lucian_Q3, slain by the hands of the Relic Guardians, rose anew—twisted by loss and vengeance—becoming the first forces of evil, and thus the **Holy War** began.

The Holy War raged for a thousand years, its cost unimaginable. In the end, no one was rescued, and none survived. The battlefield became a silent grave, lifeless yet haunted by the echoes of those who fell. However, the souls of the valiant and the wicked alike, their purpose and will unfulfilled, did not fade. Instead, they lingered in the world as wandering spirits. These restless souls, driven by the memories of their hopes, regrets, and ambitions, now drift through the realms. It is said that those blessed (or cursed) by a wandering soul’s will can inherit unimaginable power, their own strength magnified by the lingering purpose of the fallen.

Among these wandering spirits walks an enigmatic presence—the devil itself, stripped of its memories by the chaos of war. With its past and purpose forgotten, this devil is neither good nor evil, wandering aimlessly and causing no harm. Yet, legends whisper that should its memories ever return, the world may again tremble at the awakening of ancient darkness.

The devastation of the Holy War finally shattered the seals of the Magical Cards, and the artifacts scattered across the world. Each bearer of a card was granted extraordinary abilities, but most became enthralled, their wills subjugated by the cards’ ancient curse.

As centuries passed, Lucian_Q3’s name faded from memory. His deeds, both heroic and tragic, became lost to time—his honor unremembered, his sacrifices overshadowed by the chaos that followed. In the present era, not a soul recalls that the one who once saved the world became its greatest threat, or that the Demon Lord himself was vanquished by a forgotten hero.

Now, rumors abound of people who hunt the Magical Cards, seeking either to claim their power for themselves or to restore balance by collecting and resealing them. These brave—or perhaps reckless—individuals are known as **Relic Hunters**. Driven by destiny, greed, or a sense of duty, they journey across perilous lands, facing both ancient guardians and new foes, all for the sake of the cards that could shape the world’s future once more.
