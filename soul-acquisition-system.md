# Soul Acquisition System

## How to Get Souls

**Wandering souls** are remnants of ancient heroes, villains, and fallen warriors left behind after the Holy War. Players can obtain these souls using a special item/tool:

### 1. Soul Catcher Tool

- **Description:**  
  An expensive, mystical device capable of capturing and forming wandering souls into usable “Soul Possessions.”
- **Usage:**  
  - Can be used **once per day** for free.
  - Each use “rolls” a random soul (from Rare to Legendary).
  - There is a small chance to obtain a higher rarity soul.

### 2. Fast Rolling Mechanic (Optional, Robux-Powered)

- **Fast Roll:**  
  Players may spend Robux to immediately perform an additional soul roll without waiting for the daily cooldown.
  - Each fast roll costs a set amount of Robux.
  - This applies diminishing returns or increased cost for multiple rolls in a day (optional for balance).
- **Godly Tier Souls:**  
  Only available via Robux rolls, with extremely low probability or as featured items.

### 3. Acquisition Flow

1. **Obtain the Soul Catcher Tool** (via quest, shop, or as part of player progression).
2. **Use the tool** to “catch” a wandering soul once per day.
3. **Fast Roll** by paying Robux, bypassing the cooldown.
4. **Soul is revealed and added** to the player’s Soul Collection, granting new skills/passives.

## Optional Features

- **Soul Fragments:**  
  Duplicate souls are converted to fragments. Fragments can be spent to upgrade, reroll, or fuse souls for higher rarity.
- **Soul Showcase:**  
  Players can display rare or favorite souls, showing their lineage and the legend attached to each.

## Notes

- This system encourages daily logins and provides a clear, fair free-to-play path, while also monetizing through impatience and exclusivity.
- The lore is reinforced: the act of catching a soul is a rare, mystical event, not something that happens constantly.
- Fast rolling with Robux is a common mechanic in modern games and can be balanced for fairness and revenue.

**Should you add fast rolling with Robux?**  
Yes, it’s a proven and accepted mechanic in gacha/collection games. Just ensure the free roll remains valuable and that Robux-only tiers (Godly) are clearly presented as premium/collectible for transparency.
