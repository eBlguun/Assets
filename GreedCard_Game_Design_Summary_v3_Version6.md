# GreedCard – Roblox Card-Based Survival & Combat Game

## 1. Game Concept

**GreedCard** is an adventure-survival game inspired by Blox Fruits, Hunter x Hunter’s Greed Island, and Alice in Borderland. Players roam a dynamic Roblox world, collecting magical cards that transform into weapons, tools, powers, or unique abilities. Mastering combat, survival, and card strategy is key to dominating PvE, PvP, and competitive events.

- **Upgrade Power/Rarity:** Increase stats or unlock secret cards.

---

### Dynamic World Events Based on Card Types
- **Reactive World:** Frequent use of a card type triggers global events (e.g., "Firestorm" buffs fire tools, weakens nature enemies).
- **Legendary Cards:** Multiple players using Legendary Character Cards triggers "Soul Clash" invasions.

---

### Player-Built Card Museums
- **Showcase Rare Cards:** Build personal card halls, display cases.
- **Social Layer:** Invite others to view, upvote/like collections for rewards.

---

### Card Affinity & Skill Trees
- **Affinity XP:** Repeated use of card types unlocks passives.
- **Mastery Rewards:** Exclusive skins, animations, or effects; skill trees for custom card upgrades.

---

### Card Dungeon/Realm Challenges
- **Instanced Dungeons:** Require specific card types to enter.
- **Unique Rewards:** Puzzles, bosses, limited runs, rare drops.

---

### Player Card Economy System
- **Mint & Trade:** Tradable cards (excluding bound ones) gain value via rarity, enhancements, and battle history.
- **Auction House:** Meta-economy for trading and collecting.

---

### Time-Limited "Glitch Cards"
- **Random Occurrence:** Unique effects (e.g., double XP, duplicate last card).
- **Chaos Mechanic:** Can corrupt, upgrade, or downgrade cards, unpredictable VFX.

---

### Item Pack Combination System
- **Combine & Craft Packs:** Players may combine **10 collective items** (not bound, not magic-type) to craft a reward pack.
- **Pack Rarity:** The pack’s rarity is determined by the composition of items used:
  - **Common Pack:** All common items (drops common+ items)
  - **Uncommon Pack:** All uncommon, or mixed (more uncommon items = higher chance; e.g., 8 common + 2 uncommon = 20% chance for Uncommon Pack)
  - **Rare Pack:** All rare, or high ratio (rare+ items)
  - **Mythic Pack:** All mythic (drops mythic items)
- **Pack Contents:** Packs contain items of the corresponding rarity or higher.
- **Mixing Items:** If you use a mix (e.g., 8 common + 2 uncommon), the pack has a chance (based on item ratio) to upgrade to the next rarity tier.
- **Restrictions:** Only collective items can be used; **bound items** and **magic-type cards** cannot be used for pack creation.
- **Progression:** Item pack crafting encourages players to collect, strategize, and upgrade their inventory, adding a new layer to the economy and collection goals.

#### Example

- **10 Common items → Common Pack**
- **8 Common + 2 Uncommon → 20% chance Uncommon Pack, 80% Common**
- **10 Uncommon → Uncommon Pack**
- **Mixing Rare/Mythic increases chance for higher rarity, based on composition**

---

### Bound Item Skill Upgrade System

- **Upgrade by Merging:** Players may upgrade a **bound item** (used, account-locked) by merging it with an unused, same-name collective (mint) item.
- **Skill Level Up Only:** Merging **does not restore durability**—the only way to heal or infinitely use an item is through rare enhancements like Mending (mythic, gradual repair) or Glitch/Infinite (glitch, infinite durability).
- **Skill Level Up:** Each merge increases the item’s **Skill Level**:
  - **Skill Level 2+:** May enhance AoE, increase base damage, lower cooldown, improve status effects, or unlock new move variants for the item.
  - **Each merge** increases skill level by 1, up to a cap (e.g., Skill Level 5).
- **Progression:** Higher skill levels make the item significantly more powerful, visually distinct, or grant new abilities (e.g., a sword’s fire wave grows larger, a bow shoots splitting arrows, a shield can reflect projectiles).
- **Merge Restrictions:**
  - Only works with the same item (e.g., “Flame Sword” + mint “Flame Sword”).
  - Both items must not be magic-type or already enhanced with conflicting effects.
  - The mint (unused) item is consumed; the bound item persists with upgrades.
  - Upgrades cannot be reversed; skill upgrades are account-bound.
- **Balance:** Higher skill levels may require multiple mint items or rare catalysts, and upgrading may cost in-game resources to prevent infinite power.

> **Note:** Upgrading a bound item via merging with a mint copy will **not restore durability**. Durability is only restored (or made infinite) via rare enhancements such as Mending or Glitch (Infinite) cards, maintaining the importance of the durability system as a core mechanic.

#### Example Flow

1. **Player has a bound “Flame Sword” (Skill Level 1, 100/420 durability).**
2. **Player merges it with a mint “Flame Sword”.**
3. **Result:** Bound “Flame Sword” is now Skill Level 2 (e.g., larger fire AoE attack). Durability remains at 100/420.

#### Upgrade Benefits (examples):

| Skill Level | Effect                                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Basic attack                                |
| 2           | +10% AoE size, +5% damage                   |
| 3           | Fire leaves burn over time, +15% AoE        |
| 4           | Unlocks “Fire Pillar” special move          |
| 5           | Massive AoE, chance to ignite all enemies   |

### Player-Driven Auction House & Offer System

#### Auction Features & Flow

- **Item-for-Item Auctions:**  
  Players can list tradable items (e.g., a Mending Book, Legendary weapon) for auction. Other players submit offers using their own eligible items.

- **Server-Held Offers:**  
  When a player places an offer, the server immediately collects and holds the offered item(s). These items are unavailable for use or trade until the auction ends or is canceled.

- **Auction Conclusion:**  
  - The seller may end the auction manually at any time after a minimum period, or it may end automatically after a preset duration (e.g., 10 minutes).
  - At auction end, the seller reviews all offers and may:
    - **Select a winner:** The seller receives the winner’s offered item(s); the winner receives the auctioned item. All non-winning items are returned to their original owners.
    - **Cancel the auction:** If no offers are satisfactory, the seller may cancel, and all items (including the auctioned item) are returned to their respective owners.

- **Auto-Cancellation on Seller Leave:**  
  If the seller disconnects or leaves the server before the auction ends, the auction is automatically canceled and all items are safely returned to their owners.

- **Security & Fairness:**  
  - No one can retract or alter offers after submission.
  - Prevents “phantom offers” or inventory exploits.
  - Only eligible (tradable, non-bound, non-magic, non-glitch/infinite) items can be listed or offered.
  - All processes are server-verified to prevent item loss or duplication.

- **Transparency:**  
  - All participants can view the auction item and offers (but not see the exact users behind each offer until the end, for privacy if desired).
  - Auction timers and seller actions are clearly displayed.

- **Optional Features:**
  - **Secret Bid Option:** Sellers may allow “blind” offers, only revealed at the end.
  - **Minimum Offer Requirement:** Sellers may set a minimum rarity/tier for offers.
  - **Favorite Offer Tag:** Sellers can tag “favorite” offers to encourage better trades.
  - **Auction History:** Players can view their past auctions, wins, and losses for transparency nd atracking.

#### Example Auction Flow

1. Player A lists a Mending Book for auction.
2. Player B offers a Legendary Sword, Player C offers a Rare Bow. Both items are held by the server.
3. The auction ends. Player A reviews offers.
4. Player A selects Player B’s Legendary Sword as the winner.
5. Player B receives the Mending Book; Player A gets the Legendary Sword. Player C’s Rare Bow is returned to their inventory.
6. If Player A is not satisfied, they can cancel the auction, and all items are returned to their owners.
7. If Player A disconnects before auction end, the auction is automatically canceled and all items are returned.
