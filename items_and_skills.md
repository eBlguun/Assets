# Balancing & Progression Ideas

1. **Stat Scaling:**  
   - Lower rarities get flat stat boosts, higher rarities get % boosts and unique effects.
   - High rarity actives should have longer cooldowns and greater impact.

2. **Skill Power:**  
   - Common/Uncommon: Reliable, simple, low damage/utility.
   - Rare/Epic: Introduce combos, crowd control, buffs/debuffs.
   - Mythic/Legend/God: Game-changing effects, resurrection, instant kills (with clear limits).

3. **Cooldowns:**  
   - Low rarity: 4-8s for actives.
   - High rarity: 10-20s for regular actives, 45-120s for ultimate actives.

4. **Acquisition:**  
   - Lower rarities: Shops, drops from common enemies.
   - High rarities: Bosses, achievements, PvP rewards, rare chests.

5. **PvP Balance:**  
   - Make “kill-steal” skills (e.g., instant kill) have strict HP thresholds and long cooldowns.
   - Resurrection should have high cooldowns or be limited to once per match.

6. **Collection Loss Mechanic:**  
   - On kill, attacker may gain random item from victim’s collection (chance increases with rarity difference).
