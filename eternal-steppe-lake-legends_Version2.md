## The Legend of the Eternal Steppe

In the centuries since the Holy War, as the Magical Cards scattered and faded into myth, the lands of the world became battlegrounds for destiny. Among the most storied is the **Eternal Steppe**—a boundless, wind-swept plain where the whispers of ancient heroes drift beneath a sky of endless stars.

Here, the power of the Magical Cards lingers, subtly shaping the fate of all who roam these wilds. Long ago, two mighty guardian spirits—the **White Eagle** and the **Black Eagle**—rose to defend the steppe, their presence a fragile balance between compassion and ambition, unity and strength. When shards of the Magical Cards fell from the heavens, both spirits absorbed their magic, growing ever more powerful—and ever more divided.

Now, the Eternal Steppe stands as a silent battlefield of influence and memory. The White Eagle, a spirit of healing and protection, seeks to restore harmony and peace, echoing the selfless ideals of ancient heroes. The Black Eagle, embodying ambition and dominance, offers power and conquest to those who would seize it, a reminder of the temptations that once corrupted even the greatest champion.

**Relic Hunter’s Choice:**  
When a relic hunter—one of the new generation who seek the cards’ power—steps onto the steppe and acquires these legendary cards, they must choose their path:

- **Aid the White Eagle:** Align with healing and unity, striving to restore the steppe’s balance and earn the blessings of peace, protection, and community.
- **Side with the Black Eagle:** Pursue ambition and might, gaining strength and dominion but risking the same insatiable hunger that doomed heroes of the past.

**Boss Encounter:**  
- **Name:** The White Eagle or Black Eagle (based on the player’s choice)
- **Location:** Towering above the steppe, at the sacred Skyspire or the heart of the open plains
- **Trigger:** After collecting all steppe cards, or passing both guardians’ trials

The fate of the Eternal Steppe—like the fate of the world itself—rests on the choices of those who carry the echo of Lucian_Q3’s legacy, for the power of the cards ever tempts the hearts of mortals.

## The Legend of Golden Fish Lake

Amidst the taiga’s misty shadows and ancient stone cliffs lies the **Golden Fish Lake**, a place where the sorrow and hope of the Holy War still ripple beneath the surface. Here, the waters gleam with unnatural clarity, for sealed within its depths is a fragment of the Magical Cards’ power—guarded by the spirits of both heroism and corruption.

Long ago, a benevolent water spirit protected the lake and its people, until a terrible shadow—a **Black Dragon** spawned from the aftermath of the Holy War—descended, seeking the lingering magic of the cards. The dragon’s arrival darkened the lake and imprisoned the spirit’s palace at the bottom. With its last strength, the water spirit hid the **Golden Fish**, a living relic infused with card magic, within a sacred casket, awaiting a worthy soul to decide its fate.

Now, the lake is shrouded in fear and darkness, haunted by creatures twisted by the Black Dragon’s curse. Only the bravest relic hunters—those who pursue the cards, whether for power or for balance—can reach the lake’s bottom, face the dragon, and determine the destiny of the spirit and the card it guards.

**Relic Hunter’s Choice:**  
At the lake’s deepest point, a choice must be made:

- **Free the Water Spirit:** Open the casket, restore the spirit, and cleanse the lake—earning blessings of healing, protection, and hope.
- **Claim the Black Dragon’s Power:** Seize the Golden Fish’s magic for oneself, gaining immense dark power as the dragon once did, but risking the same corruption that ensnared the world’s lost champions.

**Boss Encounter:**  
- **Name:** The Black Dragon, Shadow Lord of the Lake
- **Location:** The palace at the lake’s bottom, sealed by ancient magic
- **Trigger:** After opening the sacred casket or defeating the dragon’s shadowy servants

The legend of Golden Fish Lake is not just a story of spirits and dragons; it is a chapter in the unending tale of the Magical Cards—a test of will, memory, and the true cost of power, echoing the triumph and tragedy of Lucian_Q3.
