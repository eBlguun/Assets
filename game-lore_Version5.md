### The Legend of the Mountain Wolves

Far to the north, where mist-shrouded peaks pierce the sky and ancient pines cloak the earth in shadow, stands the legendary **Great Mountain**. For generations, this sacred place was protected by a spirit of immense power—the **Blue Wolf**, a guardian whose fur shimmered like moonlit ice and whose howl could stir the winds themselves. The Blue Wolf watched over the mountain, keeping evil and mortal trespassers at bay, maintaining the delicate balance between the wild and the world of men.

But fate was altered the day two of the scattered Magical Cards fell from the heavens and landed deep within the mountain’s heart, where the forest grew darkest and most wild. There, a rival spirit, the **Black Wolf**, discovered the cards. Unlike the noble guardian, the Black Wolf was driven by envy and ambition, forever coveting the mountain’s heights and hating the Blue Wolf’s authority.

Empowered by the cards’ corrupting magic, the Black Wolf grew vast and terrible. Its eyes glowed with unnatural light; its claws could rend stone. With newfound strength, the Black Wolf challenged the Blue Wolf for dominion over the mountain. In a battle that shook the earth and split the ancient trees, the Black Wolf emerged victorious, driving the Guardian Spirit from its sacred home.

The Blue Wolf, battered but unbroken, fled into the deepest shadows of the forest, its power greatly diminished. Yet hope was not lost: wounded and waiting, the guardian spirit now lies hidden, seeking a worthy soul who may help reclaim the mountain and restore balance.

Now, the **Black Wolf** rules the mountain as a tyrant, its power drawn from the stolen Magical Cards. The once-peaceful slopes are haunted by storms and fear, and only the bravest relic hunters dare seek the truth behind the legend. It is said that if one can defeat the Black Wolf and return the cards to the Blue Wolf, the guardian spirit will once again rise—and the mountain will be at peace.
