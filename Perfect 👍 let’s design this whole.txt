### ⚔️ Forgotten Hero Dimension Trial

#### 1. Trigger Conditions

* Player must **become Blade Sovereign** (Sword path).
* Upon achieving this, an **event cutscene** triggers:

  * The player is pulled into a glowing rift (another dimension).
  * A voice whispers: *“Prove your worth to the one who wielded all…”*
* You enter the **Hall of Echoes**, where the Forgotten Hero waits.

#### 2. The Forgotten Hero (Boss Design)

* Title: **The Forgotten Hero, Bearer of All Blades**
* Lore: *Once a warrior who led the Holy War 2000 years ago, now cursed to guard the path of chosen heroes. He mastered every weapon: sword, bow, spear, axe, and fist.*
* Appearance: Armor scarred, cloak torn, glowing aura shifting between different weapons.

#### 3. Fight Mechanics

* The Forgotten Hero **rotates through weapon styles**:

  * **Sword Phase** → Fast combos, parries.
  * **Spear Phase** → Long reach thrusts, area sweeps.
  * **Bow Phase** → Ranged volleys, explosive arrows.
  * **Axe Phase** → Heavy strikes, shockwaves.
  * **Fist Phase** → Martial rush, stuns.

* Each phase lasts 30–60 seconds before swapping.

* To win, player must **adapt to all styles**, testing true mastery.

#### 4. Winning Rewards

If you defeat the Forgotten Hero **solo**:

* Title: **Worthy Successor** (unique aura, glowing like shifting weapons).
* Unlocks **Secret Advancement Path** → “Chosen Hero” progression line.
* Gain **Forgotten Relic**: A token that proves your worth (used for future legendary quests).

#### 5. Losing Penalties & Retry System

* If you lose, you are **banished back to your world**.
* Penalty:

  * Lose some durability on your current weapon.
  * A **7-day cooldown** before attempting again. (Can be shortened by doing special training quests).
* Retry system:

  * After cooldown, return to the rift at a shrine → challenge again.
  * Each retry, the Forgotten Hero’s dialogue changes slightly (acknowledging your persistence).

👉 This way it feels **epic**, not punishing too hard, but still rare and valuable.

Do you want me to **add different endings** depending on how you defeat the Forgotten Hero (like Sword-only win vs All-weapons win)?
