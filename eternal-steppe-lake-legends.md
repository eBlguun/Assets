## The Legend of the Eternal Steppe

Across the vast, wind-swept plains beneath a sky of endless stars lies the **Eternal Steppe**, a land steeped in Mongolian pride, courage, and ancient myth. Here, the spirits of the land whisper through the grasses, and on every clear night, a mysterious magical energy shimmers, promising trials for those bold enough to seek it.

In ages past, two mighty guardian spirits—the **White Eagle** and the **Black Eagle**—kept the steppe in harmonious balance, defending its people from all threats. The White Eagle embodied compassion and courage, while the Black Eagle represented strength and ambition. But one fateful night, magical cards fell from the heavens, their powers disrupting the delicate equilibrium between the two eagles. Both spirits absorbed the magic, growing stronger, but also more determined to shape the steppe in their own image.

Now the Eternal Steppe stands as a silent battlefield of influence. The White Eagle seeks to restore peace and unity, offering protection and healing to those who follow. The Black Eagle craves dominion and power, inviting ambitious souls to share in its might. The people of the steppe are caught in the balance, forever searching for harmony amidst these unseen struggles.

**Relic Hunter’s Choice:**  
When a relic hunter acquires the scattered magical cards and steps onto the sacred steppe, they must choose a side:

- **Aid the White Eagle:** Join in restoring the land’s harmony, receiving powerful blessings of defense, healing, and unity.
- **Side with the Black Eagle:** Embrace strength and ambition, gaining immense offensive power and speed, but walking a path of control and conquest.

**Boss Encounter:**  
- **Name:** The White Eagle or Black Eagle (depending on the player’s choice)
- **Location:** Atop a sky-piercing mountain or in the heart of the open steppe
- **Trigger:** After gathering all magical cards or overcoming both guardian spirits’ trials

The fate of the Eternal Steppe rests with the player’s decision, each path shaping the steppe’s legacy in their own way. In this land, power, destiny, and the weight of choice are ever intertwined.

## The Legend of Golden Fish Lake

Deep within the misty taiga, surrounded by ancient stone cliffs, lies the mystical **Golden Fish Lake**. Its waters shine with unearthly clarity, and at its sunlit depths resides a legendary golden fish, said to glow with the brilliance of the sun. In the earliest days, a benevolent white water spirit guarded these waters, protecting the local people from drought and disaster.

One day, a shadow fell from the sky—the dread **Black Dragon**—who invaded the lake, darkening its waters and imprisoning the water spirit’s palace in the lake’s deepest abyss. With the last of its power, the water spirit sealed the Golden Fish within a magical casket, entrusting its fate to a worthy adventurer yet to come.

Now, the shores of Golden Fish Lake brood under a veil of darkness and fear, haunted by shadowy creatures in thrall to the Black Dragon. Only the bravest relic hunters can reach the lake’s bottom, face the dragon’s minions, and confront the final trial of the Golden Fish.

**Relic Hunter’s Choice:**  
Upon reaching the lake’s depths and retrieving the magical casket, the hunter must decide:

- **Free the Water Spirit:** Open the casket to release the Golden Fish, breaking the curse and restoring the lake’s purity. The land thrives again, and the player is blessed with the spirit’s protection.
- **Claim the Black Dragon’s Power:** Keep the Golden Fish and absorb the spirit’s power, gaining dark, immense strength and magic—but at the risk of future consequences and corruption.

**Boss Encounter:**  
- **Name:** The Black Dragon, Shadow Lord of the Lake
- **Location:** The palace at the bottom of Golden Fish Lake
- **Trigger:** Opening the magical casket or after defeating the dragon’s shadow minions
- **Special Note:** The water spirit may assist in the final battle if freed, granting the player a crucial advantage.

The legend of Golden Fish Lake is a tale of destiny, sacrifice, and the burden of choice. Its ending is shaped by the courage and decisions of those who dare to seek its wonders.
