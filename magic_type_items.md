## System Notes

- **All magic type items are rare or event-exclusive.**
- **Player protection options (Ward of Secrecy) balance aggressive utility (Thief’s Glove, Clairvoyant Mirror).**
- **Teleportation is restricted to avoid abuse in high-stakes areas.**
- **Stealing is always random, and the best/most protected items are safe.**
- **Each item can be expanded with upgrades, flavor, and synergy with other game systems.**
